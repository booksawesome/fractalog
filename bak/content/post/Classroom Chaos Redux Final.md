Hopefully, I will be able to work on it in the future in order to create a truly refined program. I would have like to put up a download of the program for everyone, however, I do not know how to do that. So if anyone could tell me how, it would be greatly appreciated.Maybe, one-day, RAD will use my program in his class.Please let me know what you (the class) thought of my project!
