I've come across a number of very interesting blogs that are non-linear mixtures of science/culture/politics/everything else. Some are solo efforts, while others are collaborations among scientists - something I hope that FractaLog can become...
   
 In the meantime, there are some fascinating, and provocative posts. Please visit ...

&quot;RealClimate is a commentary site on climate science by working climate scientists for the interested public and journalists. We aim to provide a quick response to developing stories and provide the context sometimes missing in mainstream commentary. The discussion here is restricted to scientific topics and will not get involved in any political or economic implications of the science.&quot;
   
 ScienceBlogs   This is a collection of blogs hosted by Seed Media Group (they publish Seed magazine, a magazine devoted to science <em>and</em> culture). From the ScienceBlog site: &quot;ScienceBlogs is the web's largest conversation about science. It features blogs from a wide array of scientific disciplines, with new voices coming on board regularly. It is a global, digital science salon.&quot;
   
 As of this posting, there are 15 blogs hosted at ScienceBlogs. My favorites:
 <ul>  <li>Cognitive Daily (with timely reports on advances in cognition theory and practice) </li>     <li>The Intersection (On the <em>intersection</em> of science and politics </li>     <li>Uncertain Principles (&quot;Ramblings about life as a physicist on the tenure track at a small liberal arts college.&quot;)</li>     <li>Adventures in Ethics and Science</li>     <li>Pharyngula (&quot;Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal.&quot;) </li>    </ul>    The Panda's Thumb As the name suggests, TPT is dedicated to evolutionary matters. From the main page: &quot;The Panda's Thumb is the virtual pub of the University of Ediacara. The patrons gather to discuss evolutionary theory, critique the claims of the antievolution movement, defend the integrity of both science and science education, and share good conversation.&quot;    
 Now you may not have heard of the University of Ediacara. U of E is an &quot;online virtual University dedicated to the study of the origins of life in the cosmos&quot; that has the the most impressive faculty list ever assembled. (including a Professor of Meaningless Calculations, a Professor of Creative Non-Sequitur Engineering, and a Visiting Professor of Mostly Invisible Organisms.)
  
  Cosmic Variance  This blog is maintined by a group of physicists and astrophysicists... from different universities. Although dedicated to science, the bloggers do post regularly on &quot; arts, politics, culture, technology, academia.&quot; Note that there is also a good list of Physics blogs.
