I can have an educated conversation with someone about it at least. Also, the final project is something i can show off to may family and friends to blow their minds, which is cool. I would like to thank everyone in calss for a good semester, and especially RAD for allowing me to explore something i never would have had the chance to elsewhere.
  
Merry X-mas &amp; Happy New Year!
