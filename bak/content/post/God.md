What, then, is still left to be discovered? And I mean that, not in that we have discovered it all, but in that we have barely touched the tip of the iceberg!
    
Is it <em>laughable</em>, then, that we think we are so far &quot;advanced&quot;?
    
But how could God, Him Herself, have done all of this?  It just seems like too much! Then again, is it all relative?  Do we have the <em>capacity</em> to fathom all that there is?  Is that &quot;capacity&quot; expanding ~ with each generation&quot;? &quot;Evolutionarily&quot;?  Do some have more &quot;capacity&quot; than others?    This all seems so esoteric, yet comprehensible-----  I guess its just another one of those woes of God...  I'll keep trying...
