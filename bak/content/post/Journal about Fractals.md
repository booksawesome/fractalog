Since learning about the Middle Thirds Cantor Set in which is less than one dimension and the Sierpinski Triangle that is between 1-D and 2-D, this just fascinated me. Especially the Menger Sponge which has infinite area but no volume.
 
I am surprised at what can be done with fractals. There are so many possibilities with fractals that it is sometimes hard to comprehend all that can be accomplished with mathematics.
