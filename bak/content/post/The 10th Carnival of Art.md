 Carnival by Elaine Normandy , who uses Gnofract 4D - freeware fractal software for Linux.I found out earlier today that my post on Art and Science Transvergence: Glowing Bunnies was listed in the latest Carnival of Art, a blog carnival that has been hosted by Australian artist Jennie Rosenbaum since June 2006.
          
I really appreciate the link there - so thank you Jennie!
         
I urge all readers here to check out Carnival of Art - #10 . With categories in Art History, Art News, Art Philosophy, Artworks, Creating Art, and The Biz, there are a lot of intriguing, compelling, beautiful, and informative posts.
         
And don't stop there - read the Carnivals of Art #1 through #9.
       
This is my first experience with a blog carnival, and I am very impressed with the ability to reach more readers, and find more amazing blog posts than I can imagine finding by other routes, including Technorati.

For a detailed analysis of the ability of blog carnivals to be important engines of social networks, and their potential to &quot;become online equivalents of not just TIME magazine, but also GQ, Vogue, Parenting, National Geographic, People, and, why not, Science and Nature&quot; see  Blog Carnivals And The Future Of Journalism, an excellent post by Bora Zivkovic in his Science and Politics blog.
