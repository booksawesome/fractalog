A recent book of poetry by A. Van Jordan titled Quantum Lyrics has received a lot of favorable press. From the publisher's (AP Norton) site:
       
<em>This provocative, ambitious collection explores the intersection of the infinite world of physics with the perplexities of the human condition.</em>
       
For more on Van Jordan, including how he came to include physics in his latest works, see his interview in nat creole.magazine. 
       
I am very interested in Jordan's work for a number of reasons:
       
a. I am a sucker for all things quantum. The idea of poetry with a quantum flavor, or poetry trying to describe quantum theory, seems to be the most natural fit in a world that appears highly unnatural because of quantum theory
       
b. Einstein is heavily featured. QL contains a set of poems about Albert as he &quot;wrestles with his marital infidelities as he both reinvents physics and becomes a pioneer in race relations&quot; (Read some excerpts here.) 
       
d. How can I not react to the fractal reference by Linda Gregerson in the following review? 
         
&quot;The superheroes of DC Comics meet the Nobel laureates of particle physics: Charlie Chaplin meets Albert Einstein, who gives shelter to Marian Anderson when no hotel in Princeton will have her; the fractal repetitions of branching twig and leaf vein haunt the son of a father who did or did not teach him cruelty to women: all fuel for the sustained nuclear reaction of <em>Quantum Lyrics</em>. A. Van Jordan's is one of the most capacious, deep-structural imaginations in American poetry today. These poems are radioactive.&quot; 
         
c. The Green Lantern is mentioned. Along with The Flash, this was my favorite comic growing up. I could recite Hal Jordan's Lantern Oath by the time I was 6: 
       
<blockquote>In Brightest Day, In Darkest Night    No evil shall escape my sight    Let those who worship evil's might    Beware my power - Green Lantern's light</blockquote>
        
Which always has been poetry to me...
