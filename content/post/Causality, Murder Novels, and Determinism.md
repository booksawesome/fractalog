 A fascinating idea for a book: Stephen Kern's A Cultural History of Causality: Science, Murder Novels, and Systems of Thought&quot; looks at changing views of causality through time - as played out in murder novels and scientific theories.
 
 Kern is attempting to follow changes in societal explanations for the causes of aberrant human behavior - in this case murder. He juxtaposes this with the increasing refinement in scientific models of causation. 
 
 Given our umbrella for this course of &quot;modeling/prediction/understanding&quot;, Kern's study touches on determinism, anti-determinism, and free will - perfect material to muck up our already chaotic understanding of the limits of predicting human behavior.
