I've read the articles of Joyce Kasman Valenza for years in the Philadelphia Inquirer, where she is a columnist in the tech.life@inquirer section, but I've just now come across her blog, and her library page for Springfield Township High School.

Joyce is pursuing a Ph.D. in the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program at UNT&rsquo;s School of Library and Information Science. Her blog,Joyce Valenza's Neverending Search, is an incredible resource or all things info-and ecucational-technology-related. She is also an EduBlog 2005 winner. 

A nice feature of her site is a blogroll that consists of many dozens of information-science blogs.

So look into Joyce's work, and sites - they are invaluable for any type of information literacy course. You will also e able to find many posts on the efficacy of blogging and wikiing in the classroom.
