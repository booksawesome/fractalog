Fractal art is a controversial matter, but what in the art world isn't controversial? Contrary the opinions of some dissenters fractals are not easy to make, there are infinite possibilities, it takes a great deal of talent, and it is in no way cheating. Fractal art is an innovative art form and it will likely be the next art fad. Some of the greatest art was at some time controversial.The fractal software on the web that I recommend is Sterling Fractal Generator, Chaos Pro, and Terragen.These are also free and can be downloaded with little trouble. You can also check out the fractal portion of my website.

By the way they are both unreal.
