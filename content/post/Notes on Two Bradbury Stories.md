At the end of "A Sound of Thunder," I was amazed at the slightness of the changes that occurred because of Eckels' killing the butterfly.  The English language was spelled differently, but still pronounced the same way.  Everyone who had existed "before" the trip still existed afterward.  (Think of that old conceit in the movies, where someone's parents never meet, and so the person is never born.)  It boggles my mind that such small changes are all that take place over thousands of millennia.

I read another of Bradbury's stories in grade school, entitled "All Summer In a Day."  It is about a group of kids in an underground society on Venus; they live underground to avoid the constant rains.  The rain only stops every seven years, for an hour at a time.  The kids in this one class are skeptical about the outdoors, except for a frail little girl named Margot, who has known the wonders of nature and misses them dearly.  When the teacher prepares the kids to go outside during the brief window, the kids hatch a plan against Margot.

I won't spoil it for you - you can read the story by clicking here. (It's about four pages.)  I will tell you that years later, I am still turning it over in my head, pondering its true meaning.
