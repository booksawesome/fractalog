We talked a lot about the similarities between different types of physical phenomena - for instance, between phase transitions and the onset of turbulence - and we said how the mathematics at the boundary is similar in both cases.  This may be, but even if the equations for the two phenomena match up, I still don't see how the wide-reaching concept of universality can pair them.  Phase transitions involve changes among the solid, liquid, and gaseous states of matter; turbulence involves a multiplicity of frequencies in an oscillating fluid, resulting in "turbulent or not turbulent".  I see no way to parallel these two problems, between three states and two states.

I agree a lot with Goethe's views on color, in particular that perception of color is subjective.  I read an article two months ago, talking about linguists' analysis of color words in different languages.  In ancient societies, some say, the people had fewer words for colors - the Greeks had only identified a handful.  It is interesting to think that perhaps, back then, they actually couldn't see as many colors as we can today.  That would be <i>very</i> subjective, no?

Information about the linguistic analysis of color words can be found at the Straight Dope; there is also a nice chart here.
