Philadelphia-area artist Paul Santoleri draws/paints amazing images that are evocative of fractals. Not the Mandelbrot-class fractals that are the staple of most fractalologists and fractal software, butreminiscent of the fiendishly delicate and organic-looking fractals created by Clifford Pickover.
 
Only Pickover does his with a computer, while Santoleri paints his. The image at the top of this post is titled <em>Red Spider, </em>and is a 2' by 2' painting using acrylic on canvas. (Santoleri also paints on a very large scale: he is also a muralist, and has done 70+ large murals around the world, with a few in Philadelphia.
 
Here's a fairly well-known Pickover creation titled <em>From the X-Files</em>. See more of Picover by clicking here.

While Pickover has done an enormous amount of spreading the fractal word, and has been a great spokesman for the melding of art and mathematics, I find Santoleri's work much more interesting because its organic-like nature is truly evident, paintedwithout any dependence on computers. In Santoleri's own words:
 
<blockquote> In my works I erase the borders between the visible and invisible matter and create a new medium generating object and beings whose meaning, gender, and whereabouts is unclear and not important. My works should be viewed just as a part of the moving beyond their bounds whole that knows no spatial or temporal limitations.</blockquote>
 
Pickover certainly captures an artistic view of infinity with his images, but they are more of space alone and can't compete with Santoleri's temporal infinity.
