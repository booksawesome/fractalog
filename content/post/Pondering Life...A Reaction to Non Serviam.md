It has always bothered me that if a program stopped running or an error occurred, then I could not obtain a direct response to my questioning what had caused the error. I think that I now see that I find it unnatural to communicate with this entity as it does not possess consciousness (a term described frequently in <em>Non Serviam</em>).
    
 A computer does not perceive the contradictions that qualify humanity. Logic is not the only component of a person; beings are diverse. As mathematics underlies the structure of the world, the &quot;chaotic&quot; element are the perspectives of human beings. We see things as we perceive them, and so the world is defined intrinsically to each individual as such. However, are these decisions and perspectives &quot;programmed&quot; into us? If so, can is it possible for us to ever replicate this program?
    
So many other questions remain in my mind from this reading: Why have we been &quot;created&quot;? What is the general purpose of humanity? What is my individual purpose? Are humans guided by some unknowing force? How do religious beliefs factor into our existence?
    
I had never before considered the idea of an &quot;intermediate&quot; God, where the one who has directly created us has been created by yet another &quot;higher&quot; power. Is this chain infinite? Can a process then ever be broken down to one?...
    
These questions plague my mind. I feel as though humans are trapped in the midst of incomprehensible infinities, never able to grasp the full extent of everything in the universe and yet not ever quite able to break down one situation, one entity completely (some sort of fractal nature).
    
What I do realize is that the scope of the world is beyond me; more specifically, I think that the reality of one's individuality is beyond any limited human perspective.
