A lot has been written about the latest Isaacson bio of Einstein, and it's now on all US best-seller lists. Remarkably, there is another Einstein bio just released by J&uuml;urgen Neffe (actually released 2 years ago in Germany and then most of Europe where it has been a best-seller equivalent to Isaacson) .
    
I was lucky enough to get the Inquirer assignment for both of them. See the full review. (Because the Inquirer piece was restricted to 850 words, I will have much more to say about both of these books shortly.)
 
    
 
They're both amazing books, with Neffe's maybe the more interesting... If you have the time, read them both!
